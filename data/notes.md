## Other helpful online information

* [Someone trying to provide power to first class seats](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/f3k6qs/first_class_airplane_seat_project_help/) (unsure of seat model, but may be similar electronics)
* [Wiring diagram, single seat](https://wingdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/25-26-38-TESTO-PART-2-.pdf) for B767-300 (looks like a different seat model, but wiring principles may be similar?)

## Notes
* two seats
* left side looks like it was wall-facing, right side has step up
* indicated as Row 11 (separately: this would be second row First Class), looks to be 11A & 11C
* Seats would normally be motorized to move in various ways
* Without power, the seat joints can be moved by hand if a particular joint is unlocked
* Lock/unlock panel is at lower front of seat, under foot section (which can be lifted clear if unlocked)
* underseat electronics boxes (left to right):
  * under left seat: PGA Electronic PN: P78621B470 "ECU Electronic Control Unit (FCBE)"
  * under center: Boeing / Matsushita "Seat Electronics Box RD-AX4406"
  * under right seat: Astronics "AC In-Seat Power Supply P/N 3E2Y8/1191-8" , PGA Electronic P80437-M01 Rev A (also just a power supply, for ECU?)
* Details for electronics/electrical moved to [electrical.md](./electrical.md)

## Humor
Passenger items I've found in the seats so far:
* one pair black in-flight socks
* two unused toothpicks in a paper wrapper
* one green string with split-ring ends
* one 1-Euro coin
