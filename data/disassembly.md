# Procedures to disassemble the seats

Suppose you needed to move these seats through a doorway, or up a stairway, which had dimensions that were smaller than the dimensions of the seat pod. How would you reduce the size of the seat components to move them to a final location? This is what worked for me; your mileage may vary.

## Initial seat pod dimensions

Width:

  widest point: 50 inches (approx)

Height:

  highest point: 46 inches (approx)

Length:

  longest point: 55 inches (approx)
  
## Disassemble armrest/table

1. Remove the glued plastic table surface on the center armrest by carefully prying up from one edge. [photo](../media/002-armrest-table.jpg) It appears to be taped (double-sided tape) to the metal frame below. Mine had a head start because the table was bowing upward on one side.
2. Remove four small machine screws (pan head, 2mm hex) from plastic sides going up into metal frame, and six machine screws (countersunk flat head, 3mm hex) from top going down into metal frame.
3. Partially lift up the metal frame from the forward edge, and carefully disconnect two cable connectors from the seat adjustment panels on the aft underside of the metal frame.

This removes some weight from the seats, but also gives clear access to the back and wiring of the Passenger Control Units (armrest in-flight entertainment controls) for electrical work.

## Disassemble shell

1. Remove left and right rear foot panels by removing four (each) machine screws (pan head, Phillips #2), two from each side of each panel. [photo](../media/003-rear-panels.jpg)
2. Remove left and right coat hooks by removing two (each) small machine screw (countersunk flat head, Phillips #2?), visible after raising the hook. [photo](../media/004-coat-hooks.jpg)
3. rear document storage/central trim: one (each) machine screw (countersunk flat head, Phillips #2) in coat hook indent, four (2 left & right) on lower flange
4. interior trim panels (velcro)
5. disconnect left/right side armrest (pwo sheet metal screws each side, phillips)
6. disconnect left/right side shell (four hex each side), careful to remove any cable connectors (in my case, two on right shell)
