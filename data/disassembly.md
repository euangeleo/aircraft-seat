# Procedures to disassemble the seats

Suppose you needed to move these seats through a doorway, or up a stairway, which had dimensions that were smaller than the dimensions of the seat pod. How would you reduce the size of the seat components to move them to a final location? This is what worked for me; your mileage may vary.

## Initial seat pod dimensions

Width, widest point: 50 inches (approx)

Height, highest point: 46 inches (approx)

Length, longest point: 55 inches (approx)
  
## Disassemble armrest/table

1. Remove the glued plastic table surface on the center armrest by carefully prying up from one edge. [photo](../media/002-armrest-table.jpg) It appears to be taped (double-sided tape) to the metal frame below. Mine had a head start because the table was bowing upward on one side.

2. Remove four small machine screws (pan head, 2mm hex) from plastic sides going up into metal frame, and six machine screws (countersunk flat head, 3mm hex) from top going down into metal frame.
3. Partially lift up the metal frame from the forward edge [photo](../media/004-armrest-table-frame.jpg), and carefully disconnect two cable connectors from the seat adjustment panels on the aft underside of the metal frame. [photo](../media/005-armrest-connectors.jpg)

This removes some weight from the seats, but also gives clear access to the back and wiring of the Passenger Control Units (armrest in-flight entertainment controls) for electrical work. Be aware that this also reduces the strength of the center console, so be careful when moving so as not to overstress the console.

## Disassemble shell

1. Remove left and right rear foot panels by removing four (each) machine screws (pan head, Phillips #2), two from each side of each panel. [photo](../media/006-rear-panels.jpg)
2. Remove left and right coat hooks by removing two (each) small machine screw (countersunk flat head, Phillips #2?), visible after raising the hook. [photo](../media/007-coat-hooks.jpg)
3. Remove rear document storage/central trim: one (each) machine screw (countersunk flat head, Phillips #2) in coat hook indent, four (2 left & right) on lower flange [photo](../media/008-center-panel-lower-screws.jpg)
4. Remove interior trim panels (attached by velcro). [photo](../media/009-velcro-panel.jpg)
5. Disconnect the left and right side inner armrest end (two sheet metal screws each side, phillips). [photo](../media/010-armrest.jpg)
6. Disconnect the left and right side shell from the center pillar by removing three screws each side connecting the upper portion to the central pillar (where the eading lights come out of) (countersunk flat head, Phillips #2) [photo](../media/011-upper-shell.jpg), and at least two screws from the lower metal bridge (pan head, Phillips #2) [photo](../media/012-lower-shell.jpg)
6. Disconnect the left and right side shell from the seat frame base (four hex each side, some 2mm some 3mm) [photo](../media/013-shell-to-frame.jpg), being careful to remove any cable connectors (in my case, two on right shell). The clearance to get to these screws was very tricky; changing the recline of the seats and finding creative ways to access them helped.

7. Disconnect four hex nuts (going downward into bolts) holding the center pillar to the main seat frame [photo](../media/016-center-pillar.jpg), being careful to remove any cable connectors (two to reading lights, along with cable ties). [photo](../media/017-center-pillar-cables.jpg)

## Final state

Recline seats manually to flat configuration with legrest and footrest stowed. [photo 1](../media/018-final-top.jpg), [photo 2](../media/019-final-back.jpg)

Width, widest point: 48 inches (approx)

Height, highest point: 26.5 inches (approx)

Length, longest point: 51.5 inches (approx)

Move through doorways/stairs with "length" in vertical direction, "height" in horizontal direction.
