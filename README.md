# aircraft-seat
Documentation and data collection for the purpose of turning a pair of aircraft seats into functional home furniture

## CURRENT NEEDS

* Were you cabin crew on an aircraft that used Sicma Majesty seats in business or first class? Could you share some of what you know about the operation of these seats? In particular:
  * There are two small conducting points on the right side of the outer shell of this seat. Do you know what those were for? (My current guess: something that might allow cabin crew to quickly reset the positions of the seats?)

* Do you know about the maintenance of the underseat boxes that control In Flight Entertainment, or that control seat position? Could you share some of what you know about the power needs and signal inputs to these devices? In particular:
  * Do you know what kind of signals are sent from the Boeing / Matsushita "Seat Electronics Box" (RD-AX4406) to the seat-arm control panel (Matsushita PCU RD-AX6530-E1), and what kinds of signals are sent from the seat-arm control panel back to the SEB?
